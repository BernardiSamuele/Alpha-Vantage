## Overview
This project provides real time marketing data based on the company you want to search for.
## API
To retrieve all the data we use the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). This API provides you real time marketing data with a request by company, or all the possible companies from a bunch of letters making possible the autocomplete search in this project.
## Search Endpoint
This functionality allows you to type a bunch of letters and find all the companies that start with that string, so we can provide you all the possible companies.
## Example
You can type micros to find Microsoft Corporation
